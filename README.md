# Data Science Bootcamp with Correlation One DS4A

### Data Science for All ([DS4A](https://www.correlation-one.com/en/data-science-for-all)) Group Project

#### Project Description
It is well known that climate change, long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns, is predicted to have damaging effects on human society and earth's biodiversity. According to the UNEP, only a “rapid transformation of societies” can help us limit the worst effects. Unfortunately, climate change in the U.S. is a highly politicized issue, with progressives more likely to prioritize the issue and support government action.

Our team wanted to know which locations, at a county-level, in the U.S. would be most vulnerable to climate change and if their vulnerability to climate disasters affect their politics, and more specifically their voting patterns. We tested the hypothesis that U.S. counties with more Democrat leaning politics would be less socially vulnerable and have greater community resilience in the face of climate disaster. We used the most significant explanatory variables (social vulnerability, resilience score, and a composite risk score) in an OLS linear model.

#### Conclusions
The preliminary EDA revealed that there were statistically significant differences in our explanatory variables and our response variable, political lean. We discovered that larger cities had higher risk and vulnerability scores due to the sheer number of buildings and people that encountered a climate event. And since large cities tend to lean left politically, it was Democrat counties that were more vulnerable to climate disaster. Our multivariate model only explained 15.7% of variance in political lean and we could not confidently reject our null hypothesis. Please read the full report linked below for more details.
